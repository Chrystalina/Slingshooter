# Slingshooter

For the Slingshooter Game I've edited, the Unity 5.0 Enginge is necessary.
It runs on a PC with Windows installed.
The textures are partly created with Adobe Photoshop and can be opened with this program.
The object assets like the hedgehog and the slingshot were built with Maya.

No other special things or any additional software are required to start the game.
